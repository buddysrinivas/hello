        One man has died and five people have been injured in a two-car collision at Woodville.<br/>
 

At about 2.15am today a red Ford sedan and a silver Toyota sedan were travelling in opposite directions on Torrens Road, when they collided near the intersection of Torrens Road and Fletcher Street.<br/>

Sadly, a 24-year-old man from Woodville North, who was a passenger in the Ford, died enroute to hospital.<br/>

Five other people involved in the collision were taken to the QEH for treatment for minor injuries.<br/>

A 42-year-old man from Woodville North has been arrested and charged with causing death by dangerous driving.<br/>

He will appear in court at a later date.<br/>

The man's death takes the state's road toll to 91, compared with 98 at the same time last year.
